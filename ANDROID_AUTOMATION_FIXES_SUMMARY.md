orchestrator.perform_human_tap(session_id, 540, 960)
orchestrator.perform_human_swipe(session_id, 100, 100, 900, 1800)
```

### Touch Pattern Generation
```python
from automation.android.touch_pattern_generator import HumanTouchGenerator

generator = HumanTouchGenerator(1080, 1920)
generator.set_human_profile('elderly')  # Slower, more careful
tap_pattern = generator.generate_tap_pattern(540, 960)
