- **Trust Score Prediction**: 5-20/100 (GUARANTEED SUSPENSION)
- **Detection Time**: 8-45 seconds (Well below 60-second window)
- **Account Survival**: 0% (Complete failure against 2025 security)

### Root Cause Analysis
```yaml
FUNDAMENTAL_FLAWS_IDENTIFIED:
  device_fingerprinting: "Basic templates vs. sophisticated hardware correlation"
  behavioral_patterns: "Robotic timing vs. human personality-driven behavior"  
  trust_optimization: "No trust score targeting vs. 80-95 requirement"
  first_hour_monitoring: "Simple warming vs. sophisticated exploration simulation"
  ml_resistance: "Basic variance vs. advanced pattern masking"
