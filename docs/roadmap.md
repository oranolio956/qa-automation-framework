# Roadmap & Milestones

Timeline assumes 8 months total, split into four phases. Each phase ends with acceptance criteria and a demoable increment.

## Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1–2)

Deliverables:
- Multi-step onboarding (Welcome, Business Info, Document Upload, Review)
- Auth0 auth with MFA, session handling
- PostgreSQL + MongoDB schemas provisioned; API framework online
- Basic document upload with S3 pre-signed URLs and status tracking

Acceptance Criteria:
- Users can complete Steps 1–3 with autosave and resume
- Files up to configured size upload reliably with progress
- Status endpoint reflects current step and completion

## Phase 2: Automation (Months 3–4)

Deliverables:
- Insurance verification (TrustLayer/Veriforce) with webhooks
- State license verification with caching + manual fallback
- Banking verification via Plaid (instant + micro-deposit)
- Email list import endpoint and processing

Acceptance Criteria:
- Insurance and license statuses update within 2 minutes p95 of provider callback
- Bank verification reaches `verified` in sandbox flows; micro-deposits reconciled
- All verification updates are idempotent and audited

## Phase 3: Enhancement (Months 5–6)

Deliverables:
- Gamification: badges, progress rings, milestones
- PWA offline capability (Workbox, IndexedDB)
- Realtime updates via Socket.io
- Advanced error handling and recovery (retry queues, DLQ visibility)

Acceptance Criteria:
- Offline edits survive connectivity loss and sync on reconnect
- Realtime progress events render within 300ms p95
- A11y checks pass WCAG 2.1 AA on core flows

## Phase 4: Intelligence (Months 7–8)

Deliverables:
- AI OCR extraction with >90% field accuracy on validation set
- Smart job matching MVP (geo, skills, availability)
- Performance analytics dashboard (onboarding funnel, verification SLAs)
- Predictive renewal alerts (expiration prediction + reminders)

Acceptance Criteria:
- OCR benchmark report with precision/recall per field
- Matching model A/B shows improved assignment efficiency vs baseline
- Dashboard live with agreed KPIs and thresholds
- Renewal notifications sent ≥ 14 days before expiration

## Cross-Cutting: Security, QA, and Observability

- Security controls (MFA, encryption, audit, webhooks signatures) implemented by Phase 2
- CI gates, test coverage, and SLO alerting in place by Phase 3

## Risks & Mitigations

- Third-party API instability → circuit breakers, retries, manual fallback
- Seasonal traffic spikes → HPA tuning, load tests, pre-provisioned capacity
- OCR accuracy variance → human-in-the-loop review for low-confidence cases

## Launch Readiness Checklist

- Pen test completed; critical issues remediated
- On-call rotation and runbooks ready
- Error budgets and SLOs defined and dashboarded
