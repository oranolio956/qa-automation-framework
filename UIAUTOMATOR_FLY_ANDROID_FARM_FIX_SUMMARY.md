## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Android farm configuration
FLY_ANDROID_HOST=android-device-farm-prod.fly.dev
FLY_ANDROID_APP=android-device-farm-prod
ANDROID_FARM_URL=android-device-farm-prod.fly.dev
```

### Farm Device Ports
- Primary: 5555
- Additional: 5556, 5557, 5558, 5559
- Automatic port scanning for device discovery

## Usage Examples

### Basic Farm Connection
```python
from automation.android.fly_android_integration import get_fly_android_manager

# Get farm manager
manager = get_fly_android_manager()

# Discover and connect to farm devices
devices = manager.discover_farm_devices()
if devices:
    device = manager.connect_to_farm_device(devices[0])
    if device:
        print(f"Connected to {device.device_id}")
```

### Snapchat Automation with Farm
```python
from automation.snapchat.fly_integration_patch import ensure_patches_applied
from automation.snapchat.stealth_creator import SnapchatStealthCreator

# Apply farm patches
ensure_patches_applied()

# Create stealth creator with farm support
creator = SnapchatStealthCreator(use_remote_farm=True)

# Generate profile and create account
profile = creator.generate_stealth_profile()
result = creator.create_account(profile, device_id="auto")
```

### UIAutomator2 Manager with Farm
```python
from automation.android.ui_automator_manager import get_ui_automator_manager

# Get manager with farm support enabled
manager = get_ui_automator_manager()

# Connect to any available farm device
u2_device = manager.connect_to_android_farm()
if u2_device:
    print("Connected to farm device")
    print(f"Device info: {u2_device.info}")
```

## Testing Status

### ‚úÖ Successfully Tested
- Fly.io integration patches apply correctly
- UIAutomator manager initializes with farm support
